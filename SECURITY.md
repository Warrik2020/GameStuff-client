# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This policy applies to **GameStuff-client** version `v0.2.0-alpha` and later.  
Older versions are not actively maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in the **GameStuff-client**, please report it through one of the following methods:

- **Client-Side Vulnerabilities** (like unsafe file execution):
  Create a [new GitHub issue](../../issues/new/choose) with as much detail as possible. Please mark it clearly as a **security report**.

- **Server/API-Side Vulnerabilities** (e.g., authentication bypass, sensitive data exposure, etc.):  
  **Do not report these publicly.**  
  Instead, please email: `warrickdev.9875@gmail.com`

We ask that you:
- Provide a clear description of the issue.
- Include any relevant steps to reproduce.
- Allow us a reasonable time to investigate and patch the issue before disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers:
- The open-source client code in this repository (`GameStuff-client`).
- API-based reports **only when they are related to client behavior** (e.g., API misuse via client).
- The private server backend is not covered here, but API reports are welcome via email.

## Out of Scope

- Feature requests or design discussions (please Discussions or something).
- Client modifications outside of the official repository.
- Reports related only to outdated versions (prior to v0.2.0-alpha).
